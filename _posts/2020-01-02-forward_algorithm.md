# Forward algorithm for HMM

In this post, I will be going through the forward algorithm and the usages of this algorithm in Hidden Markov Models.

Our goal is to compute: $P(Z_{k},X_{1:k})$ where $X_{1:k}=(X_{1},...,X_{k})$

We assume we know the emission probability distribution $p(X_{k}\|Z_{k})$ and the transition probability distribution $p(Z_{k}\|Z_{k-1})$
